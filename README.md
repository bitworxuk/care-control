Mobile App Development for Care Contol

Background
Care Control uses Solar2d to development Apps for both IOS and Android.  The Apps are available for Mobile Phones and Tablet Devices.

Assessment
We would like you to develop a simple app using Solar2d that fits the below screenshot.  In this pack we have included some sample JSON Data to use as the data source.

Create a simple project which is for an Tablet (IPAD etc)  (landscape) with the following screen: -

The list can be anything for now, but what I would like to see is how you deal with a large number of entries.  How you would deal with say 165 entries with the filtering etc.

With this being a business app we are looking for alignment to any designs.

We also looking for well structured project files, reusable components and efficient use of code.

For this example just use the data in the JSON. There will be no duplications.

Sorting would be great.

Filter based on what is in the file.
